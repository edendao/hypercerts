# Hypercerts

Hypercerts is omnichain regenerative infrastructure for transparent claims and certifications of impact.

It makes no presumptions about the data schema of claims or attestations to set the stage for experimentation and standardization of data formats.

## Setup: Getting Started

**1. As the Impact Evaluator, create your own impact protocol**
  1. Create a multisig
  2. Mint a Methodology NFT

**2. As (or on behalf of) a Impact Maker, create a Project NFT**
  1. Create a multisig
  2. Mint a Project NFT

At this point, the Impact Evaluator owns a Protocol NFT and the Impact Maker a Project NFT.

## Usage: Evaluating Impact Claims

1. Impact Maker mints a Hypercert NFT
2. Impact Evaluator reviews Hypercert and mints a Certificate NFT

A Certificate (NFT) is an evaluation of one of the impact scopes of a Hypercert.

At this point, the Hypercert (NFT) is owned by the Impact Maker and the Certificate by the Impact Evaluator.

*It's that simple!*
